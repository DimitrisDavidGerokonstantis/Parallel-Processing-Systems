# Parallel Processing Systems

Semester project for the course "Parallel Processing Systems" (NTUA, 2023-24)
The project consists of 4 separate parts and has to do with both shared and distributed memory architectures
as well as with GPUs.

During the project, OpenMP, CUDA and MPI were used to parallelize common algorithms, like the kmeans algorithm,
the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, the Game of Life and the heat equation problem.

In our full report (written in Greek), we present an analysis that delves into topics such as speedup and scalibility
of the problems examined and comparisons of different approaches to the same problem. The output files of all the
runs of the algorithms are also included in the repo.
